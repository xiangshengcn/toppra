class TOPPRA(ReachabilityAlgorithm):
    """Time-Optimal Path Parameterization based on Reachability
    Analysis (TOPPRA).


    Parameters
    ----------
    constraint_list: :class:`~toppra.constraint.Constraint` list
        List of constraints to which the robotic system is subjected to.
    path: :class:`~toppra.Interpolator`
        Input geometric path.
    gridpoints: array, optional
        Gridpoints for discretization of the geometric path. The start
        and end points must agree with the geometric path's domain.
    solver_wrapper: str, optional
        Name of the solver wrapper to use.
        See :class:`toppra.solverwrapper.hotqpOASESSolverWrapper`,
        :class:`toppra.solverwrapper.seidelWrapper`

    Notes
    -----
    In addition to the given constraints, there are additional
    constraints on the solutions enforced by the solver-warpper.
    Therefore, different parametrizations are returned for different solver
    wrappers. However, the different should be very small, especially
    for well-conditioned problems.

        Parameters
        ----------
        i: int
            Current stage index
        x: float
            The squared velocity at the current stage.
        K_next: list
            The lower and upper bounds of the set of controllable squared velocities
            in the next stage.
        eps: float, optional
            A numerical constant to avoid propagating numerical errors.
